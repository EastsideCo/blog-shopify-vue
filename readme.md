This repository contains a skeleton Vue.js and Laravel app that shows a frontend Vue app being wired into a base Laravel
template, then uses the backend API endpoint to retrieve a list of products, then render them out using EastsideCo's
port of Shopify's Polaris design UI to Vue.js.

For info relating to this repository, check the accompanying blog post.
